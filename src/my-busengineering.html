      <h1>Bus Engineering</h1>
      <p>We have an excellent and dedicated team of skilled PSV engineers who work under the direction of Francis Reed, who himself has 25 years experience of bus and coach engineering. </p>
      <p>Predominantly established to serve the needs of our bus dealership and the operational fleet, the Engineering Department also has the capacity to provide a full range of services in terms of vehicle servicing, test preparation, refurbishment, conversions, mechanical and bodywork repairs to bus and coach operators, other organisations and owners of classic buses and coaches.</p>
      <p>We also undertake full vehicle inspections for various leasing companies and other organisations who require a knowledgeable, unbiased report concerning a vehicle's condition. This work can be carried out in our workshops or off site anywhere in the UK.</p>
