      <h1>Accessibility</h1>
      <p>Southdown are continuing to look to improve the ways in which we make our services accessible and the help and support we offer passengers that may require extra assistance. We would welcome feedback on how we can do better.</p>
      <p>Every Southdown bus route is operated with accessible buses.</p>
      <p>Wheelchair users are very welcome on board all of our buses and we are very pleased to now be able to accept some class 2 scooters (up to 1000 mm length x 600mm wide)</p>
      <p>We can arrange to visit you to establish whether or not your class 2 scooter can be used on our services. Once the scooter has been inspected a card will be provided for you to confirm that it is able to access our services. Please contact us for further details.</p>
      <p>At the present time regulations only allow one wheelchair or scooter to be carried in the designated space. Wheelchairs must be reversed up to the “ironing board” style cushion and face the rear of the bus. Brakes must be applied. This is to ensure that the wheelchair user is protected by a three point surround.</p>
      <p>When buses are busy we will try to ensure that passengers in wheelchairs board first to access the designated space. If other passengers are already in the wheelchair designated space our drivers will ask that passengers vacate the area to allow the wheelchair user to board. We welcome the co-operation of all passengers in making this space available.</p>
      <h2>What about ramps?</h2>
      <p>Many bus stops in the towns in which we serve have become easily accessible, with raised kerbs so that the bus can get right next to it and a wheelchair user gets on or off without needing the ramp. In other cases the driver will deploy a ramp to make getting on and off the bus with a wheelchair or scooter quick and easy.</p>
      <h2>Buggies</h2>
      <p>One unfolded buggy can be carried at any one time on our buses. In the event a wheelchair user needs the space, drivers will ask you to vacate the space and if necessary fold up your buggy. Your co-operation in this is very much appreciated.</p>
      <p>We would encourage owners of large buggies to consider using a small, light weight buggy on buses as this will improve the travelling experience for all.</p>
      <h2>Bikes on buses</h2>
      <p>Folding bikes can be carried on buses provided that they can be safely stowed in the luggage area and they do not have any parts such as handlebars or pedals sticking out which could cause a danger to other passengers.</p>
      <h2>What type of wheelchair can I take on a bus?</h2>
      <p>This is determined by size and weight. We welcome manual, battery powered wheelchairs and class 2 scooters that are within the size and weight limits.</p>
      <p>Scooter type wheelchairs are only able to be carried it they are no longer than 1000mm and no wider than 600mm. They need to have a turning circle no greater than 1200mm.</p>
      <h2>Contact us</h2>
      <p>Please contact customer services on 01342 719 619 or email busops@southdownpsv.co.uk if you require any further information.</p>

      <h1>Helping Hand scheme</h1>
      <p>A new multi operator scheme to help customers is being administered by Brighton & Hove Buses and Metrobus and supported by Southdown. Labelled Helping Hand, this has been designed to help bus drivers help customers. The card will display a basic instruction to the driver such as “Please lower the ramp” for passengers that may be unsteady on their feet.</p>
      <p>This card has been introduced following feedback from passengers and after learning from best practice in similar schemes in other areas across the UK.</p>
      <p>The card is free for any passenger that may need extra assistance or require the driver to be made aware of something discreetly without having to verbally communicate it.</p>
      <p>The card will not label any passenger's conditions but only provide the information passenger's need to convey directly to the driver. However if a passenger does wish to have a bespoke card made for them that does state the holders condition we would of course be happy to oblige but only if this is what the passenger requires.</p>
      <h2>What will the card offer the holder?</h2>
      <p>It will allow the passenger to be able to communicate quickly, directly and discreetly with the driver any extra assistance that they may require without having to explain every time they board the bus. We want to help our drivers to help you.</p>
      <p>The card is bright yellow in order to be easily seen and therefore can be used as a hailing card to an approaching bus. This can communicate with the driver before the passenger has even boarded that they may require extra assistance or have specialised requirements.</p>
      <p>It can also display, if required, an emergency contact telephone number. This may benefit passengers that suffer from a medical condition such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's or dementia.</p>
      <h2>What kind of things can the card help with and what will the card say?</h2>
      <p>The passenger may need time to find a seat in priority seating before the bus pulls away and the card can inform the driver of this by saying- Please wait until I am seated.</p>
      <p>For passengers that are blind or are partially sighted the card could inform the driver that they will need to be told when it is their stop by saying- Call out my requested stop. (As they board they will inform the driver of which stop)</p>
      <p>The passenger may require the ramp to be put down to allow easier boarding as well as the step being lowered and their card could say- Lower the ramp and step.</p>
      <p>We also have passengers that have extra special requirements such as a pushchair that has oxygen being carried. The card would say- Pushchair can't be folded.</p>
      <p>We have a passenger in his early 20's that suffers from a debilitating condition. His card will advise that he needs a priority seat so that he doesn't have to explain why it is essential he has one of the seats. His card, as agreed, will say - Requires priority seating.</p>
      <p>We will have a list on our website of possible cards however we will be able to discuss with the passenger personally their requirements and therefore to be able to design bespoke cards as required. We would also of course be happy to discuss the message with the passenger's representative, such as a parent, foster parent, social worker, teacher or carer.</p>
      
      <h2>What will the card look like?</h2>
      <p>The card will be credit card sized, double sided with one side clearly showing the instruction to the driver and the other side has space for an optional name and emergency contact number.</p>
      <div class="hhcard">

		  <p>We will provide a free clear double plastic wallet, which can also carry passenger's concessionary cards if required. For customers who would need to keep their hands free, a card holder on a lanyard will be available.</p>
